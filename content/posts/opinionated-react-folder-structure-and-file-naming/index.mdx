## Intro

I've been working with React for over 4 years. During this time, I've formed some opinions on how I think applications should be. This is part 1 in a collection of those opinions.

## Folder Structure & FileÂ Naming

I have gone through many iterations of folder structure in the applications that I worked on. The one that I have found scales the best is to have flat folders and long file names. Since I use VSCode, it is easy to search for files, so the longer the name, the better. Here's how I layout most of my React applications.

### Folder Structure

```
/react-app
  /build
  /node_modules
  /public
  /src
    /assets
    /components
    /contexts
    /lib
    /pages
    /services
    /styles
    AppRoutes.tsx
    index.tsx
    react-app-env.d.ts

  package.json
  README.md
  tsconfig.json
  yarn.lock
```

Here's a quick overview of what are in these folders.

- **/assets** - images, logos.

- **/components** - components that are shared between multiple pages.

- **/contexts** - I keep all of the context components in a separate folder, to not confuse them with plain old react components. A common context I like to implement is UserAuthContext.tsx.

- **/lib** - When using a 3rd party library, let's say like Firebase for example, I like to put all of the initialization in a folder called lib. I'll then export the instance of that initialized library.

```jsx
import firebase from "firebase/app"

firebase.initializeApp({
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY,
  authDomain: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
  appId: process.env.REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID,
})

export default firebase
```

- **/pages** - Pages are also react components, but they represent a page or screen of an app. These map 1:1 with a route in the AppRoutes.tsx file.

- **/services** - All of my api methods are put in a folder called services. I like to do this so that I don't put the business logic of an API call directly into a component, and so that any component can easily reference a service that it needs.

- **/styles** - I very rarely write custom css, instead opting to use a framework like tailwindcss. This styles folder is where my generated styles and any custom css goes.

- **AppRoutes** - This file contains all the routes of my application. I've been using react-router for a while, and I like to have one file that contains all my routes so that I can see it all at a glance.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { Switch, BrowserRouter, Route } from "react-router-dom"
import { useAuthContext } from "./contexts/AuthContext"
import { Navbar } from "./components/Navbar"
import { LandingPage } from "./pages/LandingPage"
import { DashboardPage } from "./pages/DashboardPage"

export const AppRoutes: React.FC = () => {
  const authAccount = useAuthContext()

  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <div className="mt-8 w-4/5 max-w-6xl m-auto">
        <Navbar />
      </div>
      <Switch>
        {authAccount ? (
          <AuthenticatedAppRoutes />
        ) : (
          <UnauthenticatedAppRoutes />
        )}
      </Switch>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}

const UnauthenticatedAppRoutes: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Route exact path="/" component={LandingPage} />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}

const AuthenticatedAppRoutes: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <Route exact path="/" component={DashboardPage} />
    </React.Fragment>
  )
}
```

- **index.tsx** - This is your typical index file, where you render your React app to the document.

### File Naming

My rule of thumb is the longer and more descriptive the file name, the better. For files that that export React components I use PascalCase, for everything else I use dash-case.

```
# PascalCase
/components/NavBar.tsx
/contexts/UserAuthContext.tsx
/pages/DashboardPage.tsx
# dash-case
/services/auth-service.ts
/lib/apollo-client.ts
```

I always prefer named exports instead of default exports. This makes it easier to search what I'm looking for in my editor.

## Updates

I received some questions about this post, here are my responses:

**Would be very interesting to see the structure inside of /components. Is there any nesting? A folder for each component with styles/test/... next to the component file itself?**

I don't use any nesting in any of the folders. I also typically don't have a separate styles file, since I use frameworks like tailwind or bootstrap. The shape of of my components folder is like so:

```
/components
  /__tests__
    Button.test.tsx
Button.tsx
```

**What do you do with one-off components? For example, a Contacts.jsx page has a ContactList component?**

I will split up my page into sub-components, all within the same file as the page.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

export const ContactsPage: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Contacts</h1>
      <ContactsList />
    </div>
  )
}

const ContactsList: React.FC = () => { ... }
```
