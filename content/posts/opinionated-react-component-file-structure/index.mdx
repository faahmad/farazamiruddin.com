title: Opinionated React - Component File Structure

# Intro
I’ve been working with React for over four years. During this time, I’ve formed some opinions on how I think applications should be. This is part 2 in the series of such opinionated pieces.

# Component File Structure
I have a convention that I use when creating component files. I like to the put the things that I find the most important at the top and anything that is not necessary for someone using my component to know at the bottom.

# File Structure
```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { gql } from "apollo-boost";
import { useQuery } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { Movie } from "../types/Movie";

const MOVIE_LIST_QUERY = gql`
  query MovieListQuery($movieListId: ID!) {
    movieList(movieListId: $movieListId) {
      id
      name
      movies {
        id
        title
        releaseDate
      }
    }
  }
`;

interface MovieListProps {
  movieListId: string;
}

export const MovieList: React.FC<MovieListProps> = ({ movieListId }) => {
  const { data, loading } = useQuery(MOVIE_LIST_QUERY, {
    variables: { movieListId }
  });

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.movieList.name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {data.movieList.movies.map((movie: Movie) => (
          <MovieListItem key={movie.id} {...movie} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

const MovieListItem: React.FC<Movie> = ({ title, releaseDate }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      <p>{releaseDate}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

When I use a component, I ask myself these questions:
- Is this component fetching any data?
- What are the props that this component is expecting?
- What does this component render?

This is why I lay my files out this way:

**Queries first:** The first thing I want to see is what external data is this component using, if any. That’s why I put my GraphQL calls at the top of the file. When I first open the file, I can see that this component is fetching a list of movies, and I know what the shape of that response will be. I put my GraphQL queries in the same file as the component consuming them, because I don’t want to have to jump between files to know what’s being fetched.

**Type definitions:** I follow the data dependencies with the type definitions for the component. This way I know what props this component needs for me to pass in.

**The actual component:** This is when I place the code for my component. After I know what data it is fetching, and what props it needs, I want to know what JSX is actually being rendered. I use a named export and export the component inline so that it is easier to change the name of the component if needed.

**Sub components:** [In my previous post](/opinionated-react-folder-structure-and-file-naming), I mentioned that I like to have any sub-components related to the current component in the same file. I place these after the main component, since it is not required for a user to know about these components at all.
